    <p>
      This is my first Angular/Bootstrap test. The goal here is to create a notification system
        for my girlfriend. She should be able to press a button and--through the power of Firebase
        --light up an LED strip on my desk. The site should be able to get a response gback and
        display a history of all LED requests/responses.
